title: "Chess Computers and the estimated value of the pieces"
excerpt: "Normally, one of the very first chess lessons starts when the trainer states to the student the 'Value of The Pieces'. The usual values of the pieces are: Pawn = 1, Knight = 3, Bishop = 3.25, Rook = 5, Queen = 9, and the King is of infinite value."
