# Science

I'm Ido, a neuroscience Ph.D. student at Tel Aviv University, studying how people learn from rewards to guide their decisions. I'm especially interested in the human tendency to associate actions with rewarding outcomes even when they know there is no causal connection between the two. To investigate this, I use computational modeling of human reinforcement learning tasks to characterize the "mental algorithms" behind our decisions, and EEG to explore the neural mechanisms involved in this process.

# Chess

I am an International Master with a peak FIDE rating of 2424 and a Chess.com blitz rating of 2746. Iâ€™m a two-time Israeli Youth Champion and have dedicated much of my time not only to competing, but also to mentoring the next generation of players. My proudest achievement is training Grandmaster Yahli Sokolovsky from the age of 8 to 18, supporting his growth throughout a full decade of development on and off the board.
